README:
  List items from the requirements and use cases and give them weights (Small, Medium, Large)
  Possibly calculate the risk (if salimi requires it)
  Self select the item you want to work on. (Don't select more than one at a time unless 
  you have to work on both at the same time because they are connected.)
