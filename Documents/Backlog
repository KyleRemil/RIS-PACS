  List items from the requirements and use cases and give them weights (Name: Small, Medium, Large)
  Possibly calculate the risk (if salimi requires it)
  Self select the item you want to work on. (Don't select more than one at a time unless 
  you have to work on both at the same time because they are connected.)
