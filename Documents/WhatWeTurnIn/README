This folder is where we will put every thing we want to turn in. Dont blindly add things from the documents folder
as some of those documents are depreciated. Most of them are fine though.

Ideas
  Diagrams
  Written documentation
  The presentation PPT
  The actual program in a zip or a link to git or both. (Also might include just the java, dump, and FXML files in a regular folder
    just in case.
